# Weather Journal
This is a weather journal that I have created for the Udacity front-end developer course.  In this application, the user can put their zip code, as well as their thoughts or feelings for the day.  Upon completion of these inputs, the application will return: 
1. The current date.
2. The current tempurature.
3. The current weather conditions.
4. The user's thoughts and feelings for the day.

## Features
* Instant date/weather/temperature conditions.
* The project is run on a local server.

## How to Run the Project
* Import the repository into your coding editor of choice.
* Install the following dependencies, and go to localhost:6600. 

### Dependencies 
* Node js, this can be downloaded on the node [website](nodejs.dev/).
* Express js can be installed in the terminal by typing
    $ npm install express

* Cors can be installed in the terminal by typing
    $ npm install cors
* Side note: this project required the use of the 'body parser' package, but I was unable to use this due to the fact that express now has its own built in way to parse the data from the body.
